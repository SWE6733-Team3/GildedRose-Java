[General]

-Each item has a "sellIn" value indicating its sell-by date

-"Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets
-Legendary items do not expire or decrease in quality
-"Sulfuras" is a legendary item
-"Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as its SellIn value approaches;
	-Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and
	                   by 3 when there are 5 days or less but
	                   Quality drops to 0 after the concert
